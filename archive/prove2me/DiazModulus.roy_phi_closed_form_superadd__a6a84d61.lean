/-! # Roy's closed form: one part, and superadditivity

Write `F(n, d)` for the closed form: `nd/(d − n)` if `n = 1` or `d − n = 1`, and
`(d − n)/(d − n − 1) + (n − 1)n` otherwise. For `a, δ ≥ 1` we have `F(a, a + δ) = a² − a + 1 + E(a, δ)` with the
excess `E(1, δ) = 1/δ`, `E(a, 1) = 2a − 1` (`a ≥ 2`) and `E(a, δ) = 1/(δ − 1)` (`a, δ ≥ 2`); always
`0 < E(a, δ) ≤ 2a − 1`. One part: `a(a + δ)/δ = a + a²/δ` equals `F(a, a + δ)` when `a = 1` or `δ = 1`, and
otherwise `F − a(a + δ)/δ = (aδ − a − δ)²/(δ(δ − 1)) ≥ 0`. Superadditivity: `F(a + b, ·)` is always in the second
case, and after cancelling the squares the claim becomes `E(a, δ₁) + E(b, δ₂) + 1 ≤ 2ab + 1/(δ₁ + δ₂ − 1)`.
For `a, b ≥ 2` this follows from `E ≤ 2a − 1` and `2(a − 1)(b − 1) ≥ 2`. For `a = 1` (and symmetrically `b = 1`):
if `b = 1` it is `1/δ₁ + 1/δ₂ ≤ 1 + 1/(δ₁ + δ₂ − 1)`, an equality when `δ₁ = 1` or `δ₂ = 1` and otherwise a
consequence of `1/δᵢ ≤ 1/2`; if `b ≥ 2` and `δ₂ = 1` it is an equality; if `b, δ₂ ≥ 2` the left side is at most
`3 < 2b`. -/
